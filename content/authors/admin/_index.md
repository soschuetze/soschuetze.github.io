      Thesis on fine-tuning DistilBERT for classifying forms of advocacy within 21 million tweets related to the Black Lives Matter movement. Achieved F1-score of 0.89, which was a 25% increase from traditional NLP methods. Identified shifting trends within the movement, including a increased emphasis on disruptive rather than within-the-system forms of action.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
